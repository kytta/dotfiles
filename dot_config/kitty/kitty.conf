# symbol_map

#: E.g. symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each Unicode code
#: point is specified in the form `U+<code point in hexadecimal>`. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple times.
#: The syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

disable_ligatures always

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them. You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them.

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

cursor_beam_thickness 2

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# cursor_blink_interval -1

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay.

cursor_stop_blinking_after 5.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_pager_history_size 256

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

mouse_hide_wait 0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text.

# url_color #0087bd
# url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt confirm

#: A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. The supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the URL (needs shell_integration).
#: confirm:
#:     Confirm the paste if bracketed paste mode is not active or there is more
#:     a large amount of text being pasted.
#: filter:
#:     Run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. The text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.

# click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

#: The shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the
#: terminal grabs the mouse. Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

default_pointer_shape beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer. Valid values are: arrow,
#: beam and hand.

pointer_shape_when_dragging beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer when dragging across text.
#: Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

# enable_audio_bell yes

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.3

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.
visual_bell_color #333333

#: The color used by visual bell. Set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab "🔔 "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell.

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  no
initial_window_width  120c
initial_window_height 40c

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

window_padding_width 4

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this option when reloading config are undefined.

# confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge top

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

tab_bar_style powerline

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_powerline_style slanted

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

tab_activity_symbol "● "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

 tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{index}: {title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. In addition you
#: can use {layout_name} for the current layout name, {num_windows}
#: for the number of windows in the tab and {num_window_groups} for
#: the number of window groups (not counting overlay windows) in the
#: tab. Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

# active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

# active_tab_foreground   #000
# active_tab_background   #eee
# active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
# inactive_tab_foreground #444
# inactive_tab_background #999
# inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles.

shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

# allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: This only source the first valid one in the above order.
